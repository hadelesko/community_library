#==============================================================================
# Generators
#  Create a generator that yields "n" random numbers
#  between a low and high number (that are inputs).
#  Note: Use the random library. 
#==============================================================================
#==============================================================================
# Iterators generator
# Display prime numbers from n1 to n2 using iterators and generators.
# 30 to 200: iterator protocal
# Generator method to get prime numbers from 30 to 200.
# 
# write two python programs using both iterators and generators.
#==============================================================================
#==============================================================================
# Inheritance Poly
# Inheritahce and Polymorphism
# (The Person, Student, Employee, Faculty, and Staff classes) Design a
# class named Person and its two subclasses named Student and Employee.
# Make Faculty and Staff subclasses of Employee. A person has a name,
# address, phone number, and email address. A student has a class status (freshman,
# sophomore, junior, or senior). Define the status as a constant. An employee has an
# office, salary, and date hired.A faculty member has office hours
# and a rank. A staff member has a title. Override the repr() function in each
# class to display the class name and the personÂ’s name.
#  Write a test code that creates a Person, Student, Employee, Faculty, and Staff.
